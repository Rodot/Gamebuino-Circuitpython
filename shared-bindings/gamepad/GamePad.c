//| .. currentmodule:: gamepad
//|
//| :class:`GamePad` -- Scan buttons for presses
//| ============================================
//|
//| Usage::
//|
//|     import board
//|     import digitalio
//|     import gamepad
//|     import time
//|
//|     B_UP = 1 << 0
//|     B_DOWN = 1 << 1
//|
//|
//|     pad = gamepad.GamePad(
//|         digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D10),
//|         digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D11),
//|     )
//|
//|     y = 0
//|     while True:
//|         buttons = pad.get_pressed()
//|         if buttons & B_UP:
//|             y -= 1
//|             print(y)
//|         elif buttons & B_DOWN:
//|             y += 1
//|             print(y)
//|         time.sleep(0.1)
//|         while buttons:
//|             # Wait for all buttons to be released.
//|             buttons = pad.get_pressed()
//|             time.sleep(0.1)
//|

//| .. class:: GamePad([b1[, b2[, b3[, b4[, b5[, b6[, b7[, b8]]]]]]]])
//|
//|     Initializes button scanning routines.
//|
//|     The ``b1``-``b8`` parameters are ``DigitalInOut`` objects, which
//|     immediately get switched to input with a pull-up, (unless they already
//|     were set to pull-down, in which case they remain so), and then scanned
//|     regularly for button presses. The order is the same as the order of
//|     bits returned by the ``get_pressed`` function. You can re-initialize
//|     it with different keys, then the new object will replace the previous
//|     one.
//|
//|     The basic feature required here is the ability to poll the keys at
//|     regular intervals (so that de-bouncing is consistent) and fast enough
//|     (so that we don't miss short button presses) while at the same time
//|     letting the user code run normally, call blocking functions and wait
//|     on delays.
//|
//|     They button presses are accumulated, until the ``get_pressed`` method
//|     is called, at which point the button state is cleared, and the new
//|     button presses start to be recorded.
