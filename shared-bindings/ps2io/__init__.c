//| :mod:`ps2io` --- Support for PS/2 protocol
//| =====================================================
//|
//| .. module:: ps2io
//|   :synopsis: Support for PS/2 based devices 
//|   :platform: SAMD21
//|
//| The `ps2io` module contains classes to provide PS/2 communication.
//|
//| Libraries
//|
//| .. toctree::
//|     :maxdepth: 3
//|
//|     Ps2
//|

//| .. warning:: This module is not available in some SAMD21 builds. See the
//|   :ref:`module-support-matrix` for more info.
//|

//| All classes change hardware state and should be deinitialized when they
//| are no longer needed if the program continues after use. To do so, either
//| call :py:meth:`!deinit` or use a context manager. See
//| :ref:`lifetime-and-contextmanagers` for more info.
